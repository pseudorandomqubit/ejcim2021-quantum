    "Simon's problem is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** some oracle function $f:\\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}^n$ and such $f$ is $s$ periodic\n",
    "$f(x) = f(y)$ iff $x \\oplus y = 0$ or $x \\oplus y = s$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** find $s$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a query complexity problem: the goal is to minimize the number of calls to $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical query complexity is exponential in $n$ ($2^{n/2}$ calls).\n",
    "\n",
    "Simon's algorithm finds $s$ in $O(n)$ calls to a quantum version of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to code this algorithm, we first need a way to construct an oracle $f$ that fits the requirements of the problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "To keep the oracle model simple, we will restrict ourselves to linear operators over $\\mathbb{F}_2^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $f$ is required to be 2-to-1, I propose the following random generation procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) pick a random invertible linear operator $A$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2^n$\n",
    "\n",
    "2) define $f$ as $x \\mapsto ((Ax)_1, ..., (Ax)_{n-1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is :\n",
    "-  $A^{-1}e_{n}$ periodic\n",
    "-  2-to-1.\n",
    "-  very simple to implement using CNOT gates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:** any linear operator $A\\in GL(n, \\mathbb{F}_2)$ can be implemeted using CNOT gates only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composing such an operator with a new CNOT gate accounts for a row operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $A' = CNOT_{i, j}  A$ then $A'[j] = A[i] \\oplus A[j]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes abount $n^2$ random row operations to construct an interestringly complicated operator (starting from the identity). This should give you an idea on how to construct a random $A$.\n"
