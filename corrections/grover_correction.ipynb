    "# Quantum search algorithm: Grover\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tackles two search problems:\n",
    "- searching palindromes over $n$ bits, and\n",
    "- searching for clean coloring of a graph\n",
    "\n",
    "## Searching palindromes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a first attempt, we will write a Grover algorithm that finds palindromic sequences of bits in $\\{0, 1\\}^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not very interessant, but it presents two advantages:\n",
    "- the oracle will be simple to write\n",
    "- the number of acceptable solutions can be easily computed!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To write our search algorithm we need two ingredients: a diffusion operator and an oracle that marks the searched items.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diffusion operator\n",
    "\n",
    "In our simple example, Grover's diffusion operator is the following unitary operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D =  \\mathbb{I} - 2|s\\rangle\\langle s| $$\n",
    "where $|s\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}}\\sum_{x \\in \\{ 0, 1 \\}^n } |x\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to implement this operator is to proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1** perform a Hadamard transform. In this new basis, $D$ becomes $ \\mathbb{I} - 2|0^n\\rangle\\langle 0^n|$ which is the identity where the top left entry is $-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2** bit flip all the qubits. In this new basis, $D$ is the identity with a single $-1$ in the bottom right entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3** perform a phase flip controlled by all the qubits. This effectively implements $D$ in the current basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4** undo step 2 & 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a `QRoutine` object to wrap the diffusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**hint** `QRoutine`objects have a `.compute()`  and `.uncompute()` method that can be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that, given a number of qubits, returns a QRoutine implementing Grover's diffusion operator.\n"
